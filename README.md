**xp.js** The framework for modern React applications.

**xp.js-styled** is a single package from that framework.

Build enterprise scalable styled components with minimal schema definition.

## Features

- **Autogenerated CSS-in-JSX**:
  Automatically generate CSS-in-JSX props for your components,
  making easy to inline style them directly.
  ###
- **Media Queries**:
  Encourages devs to easily code responsive components by default,
  with a plain simple and flexible media queries API.
  ###
- **Deep Schema:**
  Style schemas can hold schemas recursively,
  allowing to consider specific cases faster when using queries.
  ###
- **Color Pallete**:
  Built-in with lots of colors with luminance range.
  Examples: "red.200", "amber.300", "nature.750", "sky.250"
  ###
- **Variants Support:**
  Included support for style variants on your components.

## Installation

Here you can copy/paste to install from usual package managers.

```sh
yarn add xp.js-styled
```

```sh
npm install xp.js-styled
```

# Quick Start

The following guide will teach you how to get this working rather fast!

The function `createStyled` returns a optimized High-Order wrapper around your component. Styled components subscribes to the given style schema reactively, to optimally perform updates from device layout shift, operative system, or dark-light switches, among any other defined media-query.

Let's start creating a simple Styled View.

```jsx
export const Box = createStyled(View);
```

`Box` now can be inline styled. Notice we pass some usual style props like `backgroundColor`, `width`, `height` and `padding` as **plain props** now instead.

```jsx
export default function Component() {
  return (
    <Box backgroundColor="nature.900" width={200} height={150} padding={"md"} alignItems="center" justifyContent="center">
      ...
    </Box>
  );
}
```

Even better, we can pass shortcut props and they will mapped very similar to Tailwind, but don't use className.

```jsx
export default function Component() {
  return (
    <Box bgColor="nature.900" w={200} h={150} p={"md"} center>
      ...
    </Box>
  );
}
```

Notice the shortcut `center`. This property will replace alignItems and justifyContent for those who want to quickly center elements, allowing developers to move quickly.

## Media Queries

If the style you are aiming for, requires to apply theming base on specific conditions, you can use media queries during your style schema definition.

In this brief example, we apply `backgroundColor` and `padding`, but conditionally override those values when the device breaks the "medium" breakpoint.

```jsx
export const ComplexComponent = createStyled(View, {
  bgColor: "blueViolet.800",
  p: "md",
  "@md": {
    bgColor: "blueViolet.700",
    p: "xl",
  },
});
```

For more precise control, especially when multiple conditions are involved, it's necessary to deep-nest your queries appropriately. The order of the queries matters.

```jsx
export const Box = createStyled(View, {
  bgColor: "gray.500",
  "@xl": {
    bgColor: "yellow.450",
    "@android": {
      bgColor: "blue.300",
      "@dark": {
        bgColor: "purple.200",
      },
    },
    "@ios": {
      bgColor: "green.300",
      "@dark": {
        bgColor: "yellow.200",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

For more details regarding the media queries included, the following tables contains the full list:
